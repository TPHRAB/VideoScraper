# VideoScraper

## About

VideoScraper is a tool to download videos from YouTube, Twitter, and bilibili. It 
will not directly download video segments created by the above websites. Instead, 
it will scrape video links from third-party websites. These third party websites 
will process those video segments for us, and generate video links that point at a 
complete video file.

This project is a practice on Java and web scraping. The project's dependencies
are managed by Maven. It uses Selenium to imitate useractions and load Html code 
generated by JavaScripts. The downloading process is implemented via Java SDK.
